## Postcardware download

I make this book (and its solutions manual) available as postcardware. 
If you download from this site, send no money; instead, 
please send me a postcard from your home town to me at:

Ed Scheinerman, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA

Or send a photo of your home town (or your university, or yourself, or your dog, or ...) to me by [email](mailto:ers@jhu.edu).

## Matlab code might not work

Please note that the book includes Matlab programs that were written a long time ago and are likely not compatible with 
the current version of Matlab. You'll need to update. A copy of the MATLAB programs I wrote for the book can be found in the 
MATLAB folder.
